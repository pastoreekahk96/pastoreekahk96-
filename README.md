## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hello, Iâ€™m **Pastoreekahk S. Arthur** â€” a purpose-driven professional from Liberia combining hands-on experience in business management with a growing foundation in backend software development and digital assistance.

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently enrolled in the ALX Africa Software Engineering Program, where Iâ€™m learning Python, Flask, MySQL, and backend development principles. My passion lies in creating solutions that improve lives, enhance business operations, and increase digital securityâ€”particularly in underserved communities.

ðŸ’¼ I manage operations at **HANAKU Business Center**, where I lead a team, streamline customer service workflows, and support local commerce through resourceful leadership. Iâ€™ve also completed certifications in AI for Developers, Virtual Assistance, and Professional Foundations, allowing me to work confidently with tools like Asana, Google Workspace, and various AI applications.

ðŸŒ± I value empathy, reliability, and continuous learning. My long-term goal is to use technology to create tools that solve practical problems, empower people, and contribute to the digital transformation of Africa.

ðŸ“¬ Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on meaningful projects!
